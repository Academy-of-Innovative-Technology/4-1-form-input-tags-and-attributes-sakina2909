## 2.1 - HTML Forms, Part 1 (Form and Input tags)

### Code Along
1. Follow along as we make our first form together.

### Individual Exercise
In this project, you'll deepen your understanding of HTML forms by exploring various input attributes and form elements. You'll also learn how to structure a form using semantic HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, and `<article>`.

#### Part 1: Basic Input Attributes

##### Age Input

Add the following attributes to the "age" input:
type="number"
max="19"
min="13"
After adding these, click in the box. What do you notice?

##### Name Input
Add the following attribute to the 2nd input:
type="text"
Add the word "autofocus" to this input. What does it do?
Password Input

Add the following attribute to the 3rd input:
type="password"
Submit Button

Add the following attribute to the 4th input:
type="submit"
Reset Button

Add the following attribute to the 5th input:
type="reset"

#### Part 2: Semantic HTML5 and Form Structure
Wrap the form inputs in a `<form>` tag. Add the following attributes to the `<form>` tag:
name="userForm"
method="post"
action="#"
Add a `<header>` tag above the form and include a title for the form like "User Information".

Add a `<main>` tag directly above the form, and a closing tag under the form.

Add a `<footer>` tag below the form and include a disclaimer like "Your information is safe with us".


#### Part 3: Challenge
- Add a new input field for email and set its type attribute to "email".
- Add a new input field for a website URL and set its type attribute to "url".
- Add a new input field for a phone number and set its type attribute to "tel".
